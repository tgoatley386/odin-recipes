    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza is a fantastically easy Italian dish to make - and the simplicity of good ingredients makes it a favourite for a relaxed evening meal. This recipe keeps to the simple style, but you can add as many toppings as you like!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <p>For the base:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>300g strong white flour</li>
            <li>7g yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>

    <p>For the tomato sauce</p>
        <ul>
            <li>100ml passata</li>
            <li>Handful fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove (crushed)</li>
        </ul>
        
    <p>For the topping</p>
    <ul>
        <li>125g mozzarella</li>
        <li>150g cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>Handful of basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil and basil leaves. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
